# MEDP 33100 Project 1: Interactive Storytelling

## Project Overview

  The purpose of the project was to tell an interactive story about Apollo 11, which is a historic moment in humanity where we first landed on the Moon.
  
  I tell this story from the date where the rocket first launched, the landing on the moon, and their eventual reutrn back to Earth. Users are able to navigate through the webpage by clicking through buttons that direct them to parts of the story. The webpage is accompanied by animations and sound that enhance the story.

## Figma Design

  I planned out the assets, layout of the webpage, and elements of how I would tell the story in Figma. This included visual elements that I would use as assets
  for the page, what part of the story each page would tell, how the users would navigate the webpage, and what sounds and audio assets each page would have.

## Features

    - Animations: Rocket launching upwards, lunar spacecraft landing, the Earth rotating, astronaut floating in space.
    - Sound Effects: Included sounds of rockets, spacecraft, varied effects of them flying and landing, atomospheric space music begins to play once the users enter space and last for the duration of their time on the webpage
    - User-triggered Events: The user clicks through each part of the story and is able to control when they should proceed. Upon reaching the last part, users can click to restart the experience.
    - Responsive Design: The design is compatible with all devices and its simplicity and ease of use in user interactivity makes it responsive for all devices

## Technologies Used

    - Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - Libraries: CSS for animations, audio files and images for visual and audio elements
    - Other: GitHub Pages for hosting, Figma for design

## Credits

- I used open-source audio assets and images for my webpage. All credit for those images goes to them.

## Future Enhancements

- I would've liked to add more user interactivity with some "minigames" like maybe controlling the astronaut to avoid space rocks or something (historically inaccurate, I know), but I could always add that in the future.
